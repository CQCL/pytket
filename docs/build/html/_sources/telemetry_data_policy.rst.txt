PYTKET TELEMETRY DATA POLICY
============================

1. Introduction
---------------

Cambridge Quantum Computing ("CQC", "we", "us" or "our") is a world
leading independent quantum computing software company. CQC respects
your privacy and is committed to safeguarding the privacy of information
provided to us.

Software sometimes includes functionality to collect data about how the
software is used or performing ("Telemetry Data"). Telemetry Data is
often collected through a "phone home" mechanism built into the software
itself. Each end user deploying the software is typically presented with
the choice to opt-in to share statistical data with the developers of
the software.

This Telemetry Data Policy ("Telemetry Data Policy") explains how we may
collect, store and use Telemetry Data that is obtained from the
telemetry feature for our proprietary "t\|ket>" software, also referred
to as 'pytket' in this Telemetry Data Policy.

This telemetry feature calls back to CQC servers with information which
helps us understand how our users use our software libraries. It may
also collect diagnostic telemetry data which is integral to the
improvement of our software. If you have any questions about this,
please contact privacycqc@cambridgequantum.com.

This Telemetry Data Policy provides you with certain information that
must be provided under the General Data Protection Regulation (*(EU)
2016/679*) (GDPR) and the local data protection law.

Data collected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The telemetry feature will collect the following Telemetry Data:

Users will be provided with a randomly generated telemetry ID which will
be used to identify the system that is then stored in the user's
configuration file. The telemetry feature will not collect any
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). For the avoidance of doubt,
CQC maintains that it will still treat all the Telemetry Data collected
(listed above) as though it is personal data.

What the Data will be Used for
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In accordance with GDPR, the Telemetry Data will be used for:

-  determining how many people are using and downloading pytket

-  determining what kind of systems pytket is typically run on so we
   know where to target support and features

-  support for reporting faults and errors automatically in a way that
   can be collected and aggregated - i.e., after a release we can see if
   a lot of errors start to occur.

3. How we store the Data
------------------------

The Telemetry Data is stored in a managed PostgreSQL server hosted in
Azure Web Services, where it is stored with a timestamp as an event.

4. Your Rights
--------------

In accordance with the provisions of GDPR, we inform you that you can
exercise your rights of access, rectification, erasure, right to be
forgotten, opposition, data portability and limitation of processing
directly with CQC.

To facilitate the exercise of these rights, you may send a message with
your request to this effect, indicating name, surname and e-mail address
to the following e-mail address: privacycqc@cambridgequantum.com

5. Security
-----------

We take reasonable steps to hold information securely in electronic or
physical form and to prevent unauthorised access, use, modification or
disclosure. We require our third-party data storage providers to comply
with appropriate information security industry standards. All partners
and staff and third-party providers with access to confidential
information are subject to confidentiality obligations. 

The transmission of information via the internet is not completely
secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our
online services; hence, any transmission is at your own risk.

6. Acceptance of this Telemetry Data Policy
-------------------------------------------

Any user who installs and uses CQC's proprietary 't\|ket>' software (the
"End User") ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES TO HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD this
Telemetry Data Policy, the content of which constitutes the entire
agreement between the End User and CQC regarding the use and processing
of the End User's Telemetry Data. The End User expressly agrees to be
bound by the terms of the present Telemetry Data Policy, in its entirety
and scope, without exception to any of its provisions.

CQC reserves the right to update and make changes to the Telemetry Data
Policy even without prior notice to the End User. It is the End User's
responsibility to review the amended Telemetry Data Policy.
